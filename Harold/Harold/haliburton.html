<h1> Tyrese Haliburton </h1>

<p align = "justify"> Tyrese John Haliburton (born February 29, 2000) is an American professional basketball player for the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A point guard, he played college basketball for the Iowa State Cyclones and was selected by the Sacramento Kings 12th overall in the 2020 NBA draft. In 2022, Haliburton was acquired by the Indiana Pacers as part of a trade package for Domantas Sabonis. He earned back-to-back East All-Star selections, as a reserve in 2023, and as a starter in 2024.</p>

<p align = "justify"> Born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, Haliburton was a consensus three-star recruit from Oshkosh North High School, whom he led to a state championship in his senior season. As a freshman with Iowa State, he set the program's single-game assists record. He had breakout success as a sophomore and was named to the second team All-Big 12 Conference despite suffering a season-ending wrist injury.</p>

<p align = "justify"> In 2019, Haliburton led the United States to a gold medal and earned all–tournament team honors at the FIBA Under–19 World Cup in Heraklion, Greece. He was also on the national team roster that won gold at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, becoming the first former Iowa State player to win Olympic gold in men's basketball. </p>
